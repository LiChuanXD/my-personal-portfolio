                &emsp;&emsp;I was a working as a <strong>Chef</strong> in the restaurant <strong>SouperTang(Tang Shi Fu)</strong> for <strong>1½ year</strong>, since May 2017 - Nov 2018.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;But during these period, I always feels like I wanted to do even more than just cooking. I wanted to learn to manage a restaurant, so I talked to our upper-management personnel about this. Very luckily, our company is looking forward to grow their newer restaurant brand, and I had the chance to be a part of that. I went HQ which is rooted in Johor for some basic management training.

        <div class="bio-box">
            <p class="bio-header">
                &emsp;&emsp;And I became one of the first batch <strong>Team Leader</strong> at <strong>Ages Ago</strong> & <strong>Liang Sandwich Bar</strong> for <strong>½</strong> a year, from December 2018 - June 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Now I am responsible to lead all the crews, stock management, food cost control, leasing, at the outlets that are designated to me. Of course, at first I was doing a pretty bad job. But I improved so much once I got the hang of it. It was very challenging for me personally too because I was having a hard time communicating with customers and leasing with other company, because I was an introverted guy. But the more I get out of my confort zone, the more I am improving myself.

                &emsp;&emsp;But in the end I still chose to leave the company to pursue a new path, a path that I did not choose when I enter college. Programming. I was struggling back then to whether to go for Cullinary Arts or Computer Science/IT. After I resigned from my job, I taught myself to do programming from any source I found online. I wanted to go bootcamp but I was needed at home to sometimes fetch my sister or help my dad with his work.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;I do hope to think that my programming level is at least as good as a fresh graduate. My goal is to land a job as a programmer and get my programming skills to industrial level.
